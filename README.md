Dodge falling rain drops for as long as you can.

This is result of learning how cause a delay between funtion activations without freezing the game, and more about classmethods. A pretty simple game, you press the left and right keys to move and you try to survive as long as you can while rain falls down on you. You gets points as each rain drop hits the ground and the rate  which drops fall will slowing increase overtime. I even added a highscore system!

To run this, all you have to do is put the .py and .json in one folder, and run the .py. You do need pygame installed to run the .py.

Overall, what do you think? Is there anything I could've done better?
